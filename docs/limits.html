<H3>Limitations:</H3>

TkCon requires Tk4.2+.  Since TkCon is meant to behave like the original Tk
console, it does not separate itself from the environment (it does not use
send to function, except when attached to foreign Tk interpreters).  This
means that it can be can be altered or destroyed by any sourced
applications, and it will respond to an application's 'exit' call by
exiting (by default, slave consoles will only close themselves instead of
exiting the entire TkCon environment).  However, the widget tree of TkCon
is hidden from the user environment.
 <P>

Since TkCon is built for cross-platform capability, <font color=#FF0000>in
Unix/Windows environments it does not have tty/shell behavior</font>.  This
means programs like <CODE>vi</CODE> and <CODE>less</CODE> (those that rely
on tty/shell settings) will not function appropriately (currently they may
hang TkCon).  Programs like <CODE>ls</CODE> and <CODE>more</CODE> will just
spit output to the TkCon screen without any special control or formatting
(note that <CODE>ls</CODE> has been rewritten for TkCon).  You also do not
get any job (process) control outside of what tcl normally can provide.
Currently there is no way to handle <CODE>stdin</CODE> input.
 <P>

When connecting to non-Tcl Tk interpreters (ie - PerlTk, SchemeTk, ...),
you must use the syntax of the target environment.  See my
<A HREF="nontcl.html">notes on using other Tk-embedded languages</A> for
more info.
